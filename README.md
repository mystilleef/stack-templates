# Stack Template for Haskell

The default template is used to generate a Haskell project that plays nicely with Visual Studio Code. The template adds Hspec and QuickCheck as dependencies for testing. It also includes configuration files to Hie, Hlint, Hspec, Editorconfig, Vscode Haskell tasks, and a custom script for running tests in the background.

## Usage

`stack new __name-of-haskell-project__ mystilleef/default`
